Welcome to our introduction on algorithms. In this lesson, we'll explore what algorithms are and why they matter.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. Think of a recipe or a set of instructions.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
We'll compare different algorithms by their efficiency, often measured using Big O notation like O(n) or O(log n).

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's start with a simple example: linear search. Linear search checks each element one-by-one until it finds a match.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
In contrast, binary search repeatedly divides a sorted list in half, quickly narrowing down where the value could be.

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
Binary search runs in logarithmic time, O(log n), which is much faster than linear time, O(n), for large inputs.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Next, we'll discuss sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort, each with different tradeoffs.
